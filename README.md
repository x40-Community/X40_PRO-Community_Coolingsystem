# X40 PRO - Community Coolingsystem
X40 PRO is a hardware and software optimization for the Weedo X40V1 and X40V2. You can only use the full range of functions of the X40 PRO system with the revised cooling system.

The X40 PRO community cooling system replaces the ailing part cooling system from Weedo. In particular, materials that require a lot of cooling are printed much better.

## Please make sure to use the Extrudr GreenTec Pro material when printing the hotend cover. Other materials are unsuitable and cannot take the heat!

## The X40 Community Coolingsystem has the following advantages:

   - Higher volume throughput due to larger fans
   - Due to the stronger cooling capacity, some materials can also be printed faster
   - The fan seems to be more controllable, especially at low speeds
   - The air outlet opening is closer to the nozzle
   - The ventilation duct is very stable and does not break off immediately if warping occurs
   - The Hotend Cover can easily be dismantled e.g. to change the nozzle
   - The fan can easily be exchangen
   - Hotend cover can easily be printed by yourself (see cloud for instructions)
   - Further improvements cannot be ruled out ;-)
